# jQuery-work
---->Use jQuery selectors to identify elements with these properties in a hypothetical page:
task-1:All p tags that have no children, but only if they don't have a class of ignore.
task-2:Any element with the text "REPLACE_ME" in it.
task-3:All div tags with a child that has a class of special.
task-4:All heading elements (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6).
task-5:Every other visible li.
task-6:Use the DOM API to target the #square and periodically change it's position in a random direction.
